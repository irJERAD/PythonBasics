# PythonBasics
Picking up Python basics from a medley of resources such as google, O'reilly books and media, Team Treehouse, Coursera and Lyda online courses.

# Purpose
I love R, I am at home in RStudio, and deeply enjoy acquiring, manipulating and extracting knowledge from raw information data in this environment. I can clearly see, however, that Python and its community are producing some amazing tools and resources for similar applications. While it was easy a few years ago to call such packages rip-offs from the R community, remaining refractory in the face of potetially applicable innovations in the broader field of artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and optimization when working with data in the many ways I currently enjoy and new ways I hope to pursue would be a temperance I need not afford. Thus, such a rapid and less focussed study of the language is by intent.

Plus I've just begun to play around with computer vision and aside from getting hooked, I've almost exhausted the R libraries [videoplayR](https://rpubs.com/sjmgarnier/videoplayR).
Ideally, I'll get to a couple successful computer vision projects or proof of concepts under my belt and this repo will be left. I would love to reopen this repo if I begin working daily in Python and have more intricacies to study up on - of course, that may require a repo all of its own. 
  
_On to the future, for only she knows the paths we take through exploration!_
